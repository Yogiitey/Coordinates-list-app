Hi, this is something I made for ARK:SE, but actually, it can be used for anything as long as you provide a coordinate list in the same format as the original one.
This program sorts given coordinates in the most optimal order when only considering 2D distance between points.
The first entry of 'coords.txt' stays the same in the output and can be replaced with your current position to calculate the best route for you right now.

Data for dossiers, notes, records, discoveries and Genesis 2 Chronicles coordinates on The Island map were taken on 08.04.2023 from the Ark Wiki page: https://ark.fandom.com/wiki/Explorer_Notes/Locations.

I collected all listed coordinates, which totaled 234, without taking into account the difficulty of reaching every destination. Therefore, notes present inside hard-to-reach (including another dimensions like overseer arena) places are also included. Feel free to let me know if you are annoyed by that :D.

USAGE: Write your coords in txt file called 'coords.txt' with your starting position written on first line. Then run the .exe file located in 'dist' folder and see results in 'sortedCoords.txt'.
